## Welcome

The repository contains all the resources provided by the Linux Foundation.
In addition, the complete code required to build the RISC-V CPU Core through the Makerchip IDE is also given here. Please note that the code you find [here](https://github.com/ChaminduS/Building-a-RISC-V-CPU-Core/blob/main/full_riscv.tlv) is work of ChaminduS and it is highly encouraged that you audit the course and generate the code on your own using the guidelines provided there.

## RISC-V Starting-Point Code

To begin the first RISC-V lab, when instructed to do so, Ctrl-click this link to <a href="https://makerchip.com/sandbox?code_url=https:%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fstevehoover%2FLF-Building-a-RISC-V-CPU-Core%2Fmaster%2Frisc-v_shell.tlv" target="_blank" atom_fix="_">open starting-point code in makerchip</a>.

## RISC-V Reference Solution

In case you get stuck, we've got your back! These <a href="https://makerchip.com/sandbox?code_url=https:%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fstevehoover%2FLF-Building-a-RISC-V-CPU-Core%2Fmain%2Frisc-v_solutions.tlv" target="_blank" atom_fix="_">reference solutions</a> (Ctrl-click) will help with syntax, etc. without handing you the answers.

Here's a pre-built logic diagram of the final CPU. Ctrl-click here to [explore in its own tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevehoover/LF-Building-a-RISC-V-CPU-Core/main/lib/riscv.svg).
